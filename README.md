# The Movie Db

This is a movie database site I designed and developed in my second year of college. This project uses HTML, CSS, PHP and a MySQL database. The design was implemented using the Bootstrap CSS framework. It allows the user to create, view, edit and delete movies in a database. Once a movie is added to the database, the movie appears in table that can be filtered and searched. Individual movie details can also be viewed including the movie poster, movie details and star rating out of five. The movie trailer can also be viewed with an embedded YouTube video.  


## Installation
To install this project on your computer, you will need to:
1. Install a local Apache Web Server and a MySQL database server. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is a good piece of software that installs both.   
2. Create a new database called 'movies' and import the __movies.sql__ file located in this repository.
3. __NB__: Make sure the __Connection.php__ file has the correct information for your local web server and database.

### Sources
All movie data and images were sourced from [TheMovieDb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/). All movie trailers were sourced from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). The links to the images used are in the database sql file under 'poster' and the links to the YouTube movie trailers are under 'trailer'.

### Note
This project is in no way associated with [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The title was simply used as a name for a college project.
